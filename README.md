## Description

Welcome to my first Frontend Developer project. I chose my guinea pigs as the subject of the project because it is close to me and gives unlimited possibilities of creative expression. Thanks to this, I can expand my knowledge and skills in programming by creating one project. I use JavaScript as the base language and Flex, BEM and different graphics programs.
ðŸ˜Š This is also an opportunity to introduce my beloved furries to a wider audience.
